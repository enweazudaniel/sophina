            <p>At Sophina Nursery and Primary School, we believe in the importance of experiential learning and hands-on exploration. We offer a variety of extracurricular activities and programs that allow our students to engage with the world around them and apply their knowledge and skills in real-world contexts. From field trips to community service projects, our students have the opportunity to learn by doing and discover their passions and interests outside of the classroom. We believe that these experiences help our students develop critical thinking skills, self-confidence, and a sense of responsibility to the world around them, and we are committed to providing them with a wide range of opportunities to learn and grow. </p>
